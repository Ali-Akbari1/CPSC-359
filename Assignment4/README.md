The bare-metal program communicates commands to the game by polling the SNES controller and transmitting button states through a UART interface. Using GPIO pins configured as LATCH, CLOCK, and DATA lines, the program sends a latch signal to capture button states, then sequentially reads 16 bits of serial data corresponding to the states of the buttons. Each button press is encoded into a 16-bit integer, where a 1 represents a pressed button and a 0 an unpressed button. This hexadecimal value is transmitted over UART whenever the button state changes. On the game side, these hexadecimal values are mapped to specific commands, such as moving directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) or performing actions like RESET, START, or SOLVE, which the game logic executes accordingly. The program operates continuously, polling the controller 30 times per second to ensure real-time communication and low-latency response to user input
